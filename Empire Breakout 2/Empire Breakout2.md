Hi there, Whitej is here with another vulnhub walkthrough. Let the fun begin!😁️


We  will be pentesting a vunerable machine called Empire Breakout.
Firstly the connection(trust me,this is a headache even for Network Engineers and Experts!)

We would be connecting through NAT, we have our IP addresses 
192.168.136.128(Kali: Attack Machine)
192.168.136.129(Linux Debian : Victim Machine)

Your IP address might be different(depends on your network adapter)
 
Luckily and rarely the case,  the machine  has already been assigned an eth0 address and it  even displays the address
